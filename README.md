[Attack Vectors]
I discovered a ReDos vulnerability in everything Version 1.4.1.1015 (x64)

The ReDos vulnerability trigger is roughly like this,"^([\w]+)+$"


Recurrence process:
1.Enable the regex function of everything

2.Insert  regex statements that can lead to ReDos in the search box

Then you can see in the task manager that the CPU usage is very high can reach more than 90%, and everything is not responding
